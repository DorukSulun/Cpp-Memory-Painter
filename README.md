## 📖 Description

**Cpp-Memory-Painter** is an educational console application designed to demonstrate the fundamental relationship between data types and system memory. While serving as a dynamic ASCII art generator, it operates as a technical inspector, revealing how `char` and `int` variables consume bytes in the RAM.

This project is crafted for students and developers who want to visualize algorithmic logic (nested loops) while understanding the "cost" of data in memory.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dynamic ASCII Rendering:** customizable symbol and width input for generating geometric shapes.
* **Memory Introspection:** Real-time reporting of variable sizes using the `sizeof` operator (e.g., distinguishing between 1-byte chars and 4-byte integers).
* **Robust Input Validation:** Includes error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid dimensions (e.g., negative integers).
* **Mathematical Logic:** Automatically calculates the geometric area based on user input.
* **Clean Architecture:** Written with standard C++ conventions, focusing on readability and modularity.
